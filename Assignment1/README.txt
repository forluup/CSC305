### Implemented Functionalities
1. You have to use real-time to synchronize your animations. **(2 Marks).**
	- Functions as described.
2. Space jelly tentacle modelling: The body has two scaled spheres, and each tentacle has 5 ellipses (also scaled spheres). **(4 Marks).**
	- Modelled as described.
3. Space jelly tentacle animation (moving wave) **(4 Marks).**
	- The tentacles a moving wave effect, however I couldn't exactly match the same sinusoidal wave-like motion that the example does.
4. Space jelly tentacle positioning (3 tentacles) **(3 Marks).**
	- Positioned as in the example.
5. Space jelly animation: The Space jelly must float in a circle around the character. It should always be aligned with the tangent of the circle. **(4 Marks).**
	- Functions as described.
6. Astronaut modelling: Helmet with visor, two arms (just a single segment each), two legs (upper leg, lower leg, and feet), NASA patch and the various inlets/outlets **(6 Marks).**
	- Modelled as described.
7. Astronaut body animation: The character should move (oscillate) in both the x and y world directions. **(2 Marks).**
	- Functions as intended.
8. Astronaut leg and arm animation: The legs of the character should kick (both hips and knees rotate) as shown in the video. Note that the feet do not move. The arms should also rotate. **(6 Marks).**
	- Arms are fine, the legs appear to detach though.
9. The stars should be randomly seeded behind the foreground objects and move offscreen. You should generate a set of spheres with random uniform scalings. When these move offscreen you should reset their locations offscreen. In this way the number of star objects remains static (they are reused after they fly off-screen) **(4 Marks)**.
	- Functions as described.
10. You do not have to match the exact motion or dimensions of the objects shown in the examples. However, your scene should fit in the window (see 14) and be qualitatively and visually similar to the sample **(4 Marks).**
	- Modelled as described.
11. Programming style (comments, functions) **(2 Marks).**
	- Comments and functions for modularity included.
12. The scene should be 512x512. **(-2 Marks if it is not).**
	- Scene is 512x512.
13. You have to submit a SINGLE file called \<firstname-lastname>.zip that includes all the necessary files. **(-2 Marks if you do not).** 
14. You _have to include a readme.txt_ file that describes in full detail which of the required elements you have implemented successfully and which ones you have not. **(-4 Marks if you do not).**
